threads = 2 # number of threads 
quality = 20 # lower limit for the average quality (Phred Quality Score) of the reads

### DATA PREPROCESSING 
preproc = 0 # preprocessing of the reads can be either omitted (=0) or included (=1) 
modetrm = 1 # mode of the trimming: only 5' (=0) and 3' (=1) or both (=2)

### ALIGNMENT (forwarded to segemehl.x)
dbref = /Users/riasc/Documents/work/projects/RNAnue/build/e.coli_dh10b_ref.fasta
accuracy = 90 # min percentage of matches per read in semi-global alignment

minfraglen = 15 # min length of a spliced fragment
minsplicecov = 80 # min coverage for spliced transcripts
exclclipping = 0 # exclude soft clipping from 


### CLUSTERING
clust = 1 # clustering of the split reads can either be omitted (=0) or included (=1)
clustdist = 0 # minimum distance between clusters

### ANALYIS
# specify the annotations of the organism of interest (optional)
features = /Users/riasc/Documents/work/projects/RNAnue/bin/e.coli_dh10b.gff3 # GFF3 feature file
cmplmin = 0.8 # complementarity cutoff - consider only split reads that exceed cmplmin
cmplminlen = 0.5 # minimum length of an alignment proportionally to the interaction site
nrgmax = 0 # hybridization energy cutoff - consider only split reads that fall beneath nrgmax

# OUTPUT
stats = 1 # produce a statistics of the libraries
outcnt = 1 # (additionally) produce a count table as output
outjgf = 1 # (additionally) produce a JSON graph file for visualization
